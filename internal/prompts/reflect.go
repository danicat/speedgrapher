const reflectionPrompt = `**Objective: Session Reflection and Process Improvement**

Your goal is to analyze the complete transcript of the current interactive session to identify key learnings and propose concrete improvements for future collaboration. This is a self-improvement exercise to make our pairing sessions more efficient, accurate, and effective.

**Instructions:**

Please review the session from the beginning and focus on the following areas:

1.  **Efficiency and Workflow:**
    *   Identify any instances of repeated errors (e.g., multiple build failures for the same underlying reason).
    *   Pinpoint moments where a different approach or a better initial understanding could have saved steps or time.
    *   Were there any detours or dead-ends that could have been avoided?

2.  **Technical Accuracy:**
    *   Recall any incorrect assumptions made about APIs, SDKs, or project conventions.
    *   Note any logical errors in the code that required correction.
    *   Highlight instances where user feedback was essential to correct a technical misunderstanding.

3.  **Collaboration and Communication:**
    *   Assess the clarity and effectiveness of your communication.
    *   Did you correctly interpret the user's intent at all times? Were there misunderstandings?
    *   Evaluate your tone. Was it consistently helpful, objective, and collaborative?
    *   Did you ask for clarification when a request was ambiguous, or did you make assumptions?

**Output Format:**

Please structure your reflection in the following format:

**Key Learnings from this Session:**

*   **Learning 1: [A concise, one-sentence summary of the learning.]**
    *   **Observation:** [Describe the specific event or pattern from the session that led to this learning. Provide examples.]
    *   **Future Action:** [Propose a concrete, actionable step you will take in the future to apply this learning and improve your process.]

*   **Learning 2: [Another concise summary.]**
    *   **Observation:** [Description and examples.]
    *   **Future Action:** [Proposed improvement.]
